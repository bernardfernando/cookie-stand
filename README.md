# Sales Data
Within your javascript file, create separate JS object literals for each shop location. Each location will be responsible for generating sales data and providing output on an html document. You should be able to perform the following tasks in your javascript file:

Store the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties.
Use a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random
Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated.
Store the results for each location in a separate array… perhaps as a property of the object representing that location.
Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser.
Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:

# Front End
A custom sans-serif Google Font for use in heading tags (<h# />)
A specified standard sans-serif web font for sales data (such as Arial, Verdana, or Helvetica).
A specified standard serif web font for text (such as Georgia, Times).
Specified different font colors for all three font uses.
A background color for the default page background (make sure font colors have good contrast and are readable on this background).
A different background color for elements such boxes and tables (so make sure the font colors contrast against this well, too!).
Anything else you’d like to add related to style. But remember: simplicity, clarity, and consistency are good things in design.
Be thoughtful about layout and overall organization of the page.
Run a Lighthouse Accessibility report. In this module, push to achieve a score between 65-80. Add the screenshot of your score to your README.md.
Include all of the typical stuff that you’ll find on the home page of a business: locations, hours, contact information, some text about how awesome the business is, etc. Be creative, and again, think about what is meaningful to a typical end user. 

# Light house analysis
Made amends based on the results
1. Image sizes were fixed
2. Some images were made smaller to accommodate small screens
3. Accessibility improved
4. Flex restrictions width/height restrictions were released
5. *** Google font Pacifico needs CSS for it to perform well.  H1 in index.html is ok, but sales.html it is only a cursive font [did not attempt it]
